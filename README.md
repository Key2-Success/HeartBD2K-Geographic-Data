# HeartBD2K Geographic Data
This was the project I tackled Fall of 2017 at my internship at HeartBD2K, which resulted in an R Shiny App. The aim of the project was to explore the data that was manually annotated by other lab members on 3000 case reports on various disease systems. I looked into seeing how the location of the case report affected how many case reports were being generated at that location per disease system, as well as looking into age and gender demographics within each disease system as well. The result is an interactive `plotly` R shiny app.

My supervisor for this project (Clement Feyt) as well as a co-worker (Joel Perez) and I had the honor of presenting our work to our lab. I have attached the slides to that presentation, as well as screenshots of my R Shiny App and the resulting code that created it.
